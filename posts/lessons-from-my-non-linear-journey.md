Life rarely moves in straight lines, and my journey has been no exception. I began with engineering, detoured through psychology, and eventually found myself embedded in the web3 ecosystem. Each step felt distinct at the time, but looking back, I see the quiet patterns that connect them—a constant curiosity and a drive to make meaningful contributions.

## Engineering, Psychology, and the overlap we often miss

When I reflect on my academic background, it’s clear that the pieces fit together in unexpected ways. Engineering gave me a framework to think structurally, to break down complex systems and build from first principles. Psychology, in contrast, taught me to look at systems from the inside out—to understand the people within them, their behaviors, and motivations.

What I find compelling now is how these disciplines, which initially seemed so distant, have converged. In leading teams or scaling systems, I often rely on this dual lens. Logic and empathy are not opposites; they’re complements, and bridging them creates clarity in decision-making and leadership.

## Building with purpose

Today, I’m the Operations Lead at [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz), a blockchain infrastructure company. At GraphOps I work on scaling teams and processes to support [The Graph](https://thegraph.com)–a decentralized protocol that serves as the indexing layer for web3. Before this, I worked with [Exactly Protocol](https://exact.ly), [Defiant Wallet](https://defiantapp.tech/en), and [Let’sBit](https://letsbit.io). Each role offered me a different perspective on how blockchain technology can solve real problems, and each experience added new tools to my mental toolkit.

I’ve also been fortunate to contribute to Ethereum events like ETHLatam Buenos Aires 2022, and [zkCity](https://zkcity.xyz), among others.

## The slow, steady nature of growth

If there’s one thing running has taught me, it’s the importance of consistency. Progress doesn’t come from bursts of energy or isolated sprints. It comes from showing up, day after day, committing to small, incremental steps.

This perspective mirrors how I approach work and life more broadly. Whether scaling a team, building a process, or contributing to web3, the focus is always on steady, meaningful progress.

Running also provides a space to reflect. It’s during those quiet kilometers that I often find clarity—not just on immediate problems but on the broader questions about where I’m going and why it matters.

Another important lesson I’ve learned running is that the path ahead is, as always, uncertain. But uncertainty isn’t something to be avoided; it’s something to engage with. It’s in navigating ambiguity that we learn, adapt, and, eventually, grow. For me, web3 is a paradigm shift, a rethinking of how we interact, coordinate, and create value together. Being part of this space is an ongoing reminder of what’s possible when people align around a shared vision.

The journey may not be linear, but it’s meaningful, and that’s enough.
