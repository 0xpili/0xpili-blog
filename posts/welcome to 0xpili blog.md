### Pushing Boundaries: My Journey in web3

Growth isn’t something that happens when you’re comfortable. It’s when you’re willing to take on what feels unfamiliar or even a little intimidating. That’s been my approach to life and work, whether I’m wunning a marathon or navigating the challenges of web3. The belief that progress comes from facing complexity head-on has shaped the choices I’ve made so far.

#### A Nonlinear Academic Path

My academic path has been far from traditional. I started with Engineering, took a turn into Psychology, and explored other fields along the way. This mix has helped me build a broad perspective and develop creative approaches to solving problems.

I've come to see every twist and turn as part of the process of learning and growing.

#### Building the Internet of the Future

Today, I’m the Operations Lead at GraphOps. My work focuses on creating an open and self-sovereign internet—a vision that aligns closely with [The Graph](https://thegraph.com)’s mission. [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz) contributes to The Graph as a Core Developer, and it’s exciting to play a role in a project that is shaping the future of data. Before this, I worked with [Exactly Protocol](https://exact.ly), [Defiant Wallet](https://defiantapp.tech/en), and [Let’sBit](https://letsbit.io), gaining hands-on experience in scaling teams and processes.

I’ve also been fortunate to contribute to Ethereum events like ETHLatam Buenos Aires2022, and [zkCity](https://zkcity.xyz), among others, where collaboration is at the heart of real progress.

#### Always Learning

For me, learning never stops. I thrive in teams where people support each other and work toward getting better every day. That’s the kind of leader I strive to be—someone who fosters trust and collaboration, creating space for everyone to contribute their best.

Outside work, I recharge by running and trekking. There’s something grounding about the rhythm of a long run or the stillness of a mountain trail. These moments give me clarity and help me prepare for what’s next. They’re not just about physical endurance but about building the mental strength to tackle whatever comes my way.

#### Looking Ahead

Looking forward, I’m focused on building GraphOps, I am also looking to continue building ecosystems and communities that make a meaningful difference.

This journey is ongoing, and it’s fueled by curiosity, collaboration, and a belief in the power of thoughtful innovation.
