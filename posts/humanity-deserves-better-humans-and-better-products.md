# Humanity Deserves Better Humans and Better Products

I truly believe that humanity deserves better humans.

Humans who care for other humans.  
Humans who respect others' time.  
Humans who respect others' agency.  
Humans who put love and care into their work.  
Humans who are obsessed with reconnecting humans with humanity.  
Humans who make others feel that they are in *[good hands](https://stephango.com/in-good-hands)*.

Humans also deserve better businesses. Businesses that create [Great Software](https://maraoz.com/great-software/). And Great Software that makes users feel they are in *good hands*.

## What Kind of Businesses I Would Like to See
I would like to see businesses that create exceptional products.

- Products that are crafted with love and detail, offering extreme quality.
- Products that respect users' agency.
- Products that enable users to adopt healthier consumption patterns.
- Products that make users breathe and enjoy their time.
- Products that reconnect users with their humanity.

As humanity, we need to explore other ways to make products and businesses. Businesses that genuinely care about and love their users, offering them incredible, high-quality products that make users feel they are in *good hands.*

The ideas presented here have been inspired by [Great Software](https://maraoz.com/great-software/).
