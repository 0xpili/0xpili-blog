Life rarely unfolds in straight lines, and my story is no exception. Starting out in engineering, I took an unexpected turn into psychology, and eventually found myself immersed in the fascinating web3 world. It’s been a journey defined by curiosity, challenges, and the desire to be part of something meaningful.

#### A nonlinear academic path

My academic background is a patchwork of interests. Engineering taught me structure and problem-solving, while psychology helped me understand people and behaviors. These seemingly unrelated disciplines have given me a unique perspective, blending logic with empathy—a combination I rely on every day.

#### Building with purpose

Today, I’m the Operations Lead at [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz), a blockchain infrastructure company playing a vital role as a Core Developer for [The Graph](https://thegraph.com). Before this, I worked with [Exactly Protocol](https://exact.ly), [Defiant Wallet](https://defiantapp.tech/en), and [Let’sBit](https://letsbit.io), gaining hands-on experience in scaling teams and processes.

I’ve also been fortunate to contribute to Ethereum events like ETHLatam Buenos Aires 2022, and [zkCity](https://zkcity.xyz), among others.

#### Always learning

For me, learning never stops. I thrive in teams where people support each other and work toward getting better every day. That’s the kind of leader I work hard to be—someone who fosters trust and collaboration, creating space for everyone to contribute their best.

Outside of work, running has become my daily ritual. There’s something grounding about the rhythm of putting one foot in front of the other and getting better every day. For me, every run is an opportunity to work toward a goal, to push myself a little further, and to reflect on progress. It’s a reminder that growth—whether on the trail or in life—comes from showing up consistently and staying committed.
