# Assumptions for a Solarpunk future

Regeneration first. Tech is successful only if it restores ecosystems and communities more than it depletes them.

Energy is clean and local. AI runs on renewables, with efficiency treated as a core feature, not an afterthought.

Human dignity is non-negotiable. AI augments people's agency, skills, and time—never replaces rights or erodes autonomy.

Intelligence is a commons. Core models, data standards, and safety proofs are open, inspectable, and forkable.

Consentful data. Data is gathered with informed consent, minimal by default, and revocable; privacy is a design constraint.

Explainability beats blind trust. Decisions are auditable and contestable; verifiability is built in (logs, proofs, trails).

Local stewardship. Communities shape and govern the AIs that serve them; global networks, local control.

Repair over replacement. Hardware is modular and fixable; software is maintainable with long-term support.

Resilience by diversity. Many models, many nodes, many cultures—no single point of failure or monoculture of thought.

Fair value flows. People, creators, and data contributors share in the value AIs generate (clear attribution + compensation).

Safety as capability. Alignment, red-teaming, and fail-safes are treated like uptime—measured, budgeted, and improved.

Education for all. AI literacy is universal; tools are usable by non-experts and designed for inclusion.

Work with purpose. AI offloads drudgery; humans focus on care, craft, science, art, and governance.

Global standards, local adaptation. Interoperable rules with room for cultural and ecological nuance.
